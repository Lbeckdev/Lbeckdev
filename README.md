Hi, I'm Lukas Beck. Welcome to my Github profile.

I'm a front-end developer, and also enjoy doing UI UX design and digital art. I have good experience with HTML and CSS, and I'm currently
learning Javascript. I have a background in mathematics from university, and I enjoy working on challenging problems.

I'm aiming at becoming a proficient front-end developer, creating responsive websites, as well as apps for the web and for mobile.

Feel free to contact me if you want to know more.

~Lukas
