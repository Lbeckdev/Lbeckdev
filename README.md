Hi, I'm Lukas Beck. Welcome to my Github profile.

I'm a front-end developer, and also enjoy doing some UI UX design. I have good experience with HTML and CSS, and I'm currently
in the process of learning Javascript. Regarding matters of education, I have studied mathematics at university, and very much enjoy working
on challenging problems. I'm aiming at becoming a proficient front-end developer, creating responsive websites, as well as apps for the web and for mobile.
